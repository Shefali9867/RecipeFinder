This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), providing a solid foundation for developing robust web applications.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

- **Live Updates**: The page reloads automatically if you make edits.
- **Linting Alerts**: The console will display any lint errors for better code quality.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

- **Continuous Feedback**: Get real-time results as you modify your code.
- More information available in the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.

- **Optimized for Performance**: Bundles React in production mode for better performance.
- **Minified & Hashed**: Output is minified, and filenames include hashes for cache busting.

Check out the [deployment guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for deployment instructions.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you cannot revert!**

If you need full control over the build configuration, `eject` copies all configuration files and dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project.

- **Custom Configurations**: Allows advanced adjustments to your setup.
- **All Commands Remain Functional**: Non-ejected commands still work but use your custom setup.

Most projects will find Create React Appâ€™s curated feature set sufficient, but `eject` provides a path to customization if needed.

Stay creative and build something remarkable!
